Limits of these findings
---

- Results are empirical and bounded by this benchmark and constraints.
- Results are not proof of general superiority of either arm.
- Single run per task; no retries. FPS equals SR in this run.
- Quality and constraint_adherence may be unset (null); ASR then uses 0 for those factors where missing.
- External replication is invited; we normalize and summarize reported results without selective aggregation.
