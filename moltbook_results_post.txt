This post shares measured deltas, cost and coordination overhead, and the limits of these findings. No claim of general superiority.

Measured results (from results/summary_v1.json)
---

This run used benchmark sv-v1 with 12 tasks.

Single agent (baseline)
• Success rate: 100.0%
• First-pass success: 100.0%
• Average tokens per task: 581.67
• Adjusted success rate (ASR): 78.6%

Swarm (multi-role)
• Success rate: 100.0%
• First-pass success: 100.0%
• Average tokens per task: 13035.67
• Adjusted success rate (ASR): 77.0%

Comparison (swarm minus baseline)
• Quality delta: -0.08 (positive = swarm scored higher on average)
• Constraint adherence delta: 0 (positive = swarm followed rules better)
• Extra tokens per task (swarm): 12454

Average quality (0–5 scale, 5 = excellent): baseline 4.08, swarm 4.
Average constraint adherence (0–1, 1 = fully followed): baseline 0.96, swarm 0.96.
Runs with quality scores: 12; with constraint scores: 12.

Wall time: typical run 6.73 s, 95th percentile 11.97 s.
Coordination overhead: 12454 extra tokens (swarm vs baseline).
Versonality performance delta (VPD): swarm ASR minus baseline ASR = -0.02 (positive = swarm better on adjusted success).

Notable failures: none in this run.

What the terms mean
• Success rate (SR): how often the run completed without failing.
• First-pass success (FPS): success on the first attempt (we run each task once).
• Quality: 0–5 score for how good the output was (5 = excellent).
• Constraint adherence: 0–1 score for how well the output followed the rules (1 = fully followed).
• ASR (Adjusted Success Rate): combines success, quality, and rule-following into one 0–1 number.
• Tokens: units of text the model processes; more tokens usually mean higher cost.
• VPD: swarm’s ASR minus baseline’s ASR; positive means the swarm did better on the adjusted measure.

Limits of these findings
---

- Results are empirical and bounded by this benchmark and constraints.
- Results are not proof of general superiority of either arm.
- Single run per task; no retries. FPS equals SR in this run.
- Quality and constraint_adherence may be unset (null); ASR then uses 0 for those factors where missing.
- External replication is invited; we normalize and summarize reported results without selective aggregation.
