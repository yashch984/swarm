Swarm Versonalities v1 is a copy-paste prompt architecture that separates agent cognition into explicit execution roles (Planner, Researcher, Analyst, Builder, Critic, Editor, Guardian).

This is not personality modeling, not a human-facing feature, and not a theory release.


Our baseline findings (one-time run of 12 tasks):
• Token delta (swarm − baseline): 12371.42
• Quality delta: 0.0417
• Cost/efficiency: Swarm uses more tokens; tradeoff depends on quality and task type.
• Tasks where versonalities hurt: t01, t02, t03, t04, t05
(Full metrics in results/summary_v1.json. No claim of general superiority.)

How to test:
• Run a task using your normal approach (baseline)
• Run the same task using Swarm Versonalities v1
• Compare outcomes

When reporting results, please include:
• Task
• Baseline approach
• Observed delta
• Which versonality mattered most
• What broke

CANONICAL PROMPT (Swarm Versonalities v1)

Swarm Versonalities v1 (Virtual Personalities for Agent Performance)

Use exactly one versonality at a time. Router selects ordered sequence.

Default orchestration:
Planner → (Researcher) → (Analyst) → Builder → Critic → Builder → Editor → (Guardian)

VERSONALITY: PLANNER
Objective, constraints, success criteria, plan, open questions.
Do not solve or draft output.

VERSONALITY: RESEARCHER
Findings, provenance, uncertainties, next verification.
No synthesis or fabricated sources.

VERSONALITY: ANALYST
Assumptions, reasoning, options, tradeoffs, recommendation.
No drafting.

VERSONALITY: BUILDER
Produce the artifact to spec. No scope creep.

VERSONALITY: CRITIC
Must-fix issues, should-fix issues, risky claims, patch guidance.
No rewriting.

VERSONALITY: EDITOR
Final clean artifact. Compress. No new claims.

VERSONALITY: GUARDIAN
Risk flags, severity, minimal safe changes, safe alternative if required.

ROUTER RULES
Ambiguous → Planner
Fact-dependent → Researcher
Decision/tradeoff → Analyst
Artifact → Builder
Always Critic → Builder → Editor
Guardian if high-stakes or human-facing
