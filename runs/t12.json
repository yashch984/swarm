  "baseline_output": "Based on the given company policy, the following conclusions are logically guaranteed:\n\n1. The employee has manager approval: The policy states, \"Employees may work from home only if they have manager approval.\" This implies that the employee must have obtained approval from their manager to work from home.\n\n2. The employee's role is designated remote-eligible: The policy states, \"Employees may work from home only if they have manager approval and their role is designated remote-eligible.\" This implies that the employee's role must be designated as remote-eligible to work from home.\n\n3. The employee is working from home: This is a given fact, as the policy is being applied to the employee's situation.\n\nNow, here's a conclusion that is not guaranteed (common misinterpretation):\n\n4. The employee's manager has verified that the employee's role is indeed remote-eligible: The policy states, \"Employees may work from home only if they have manager approval and their role is designated remote-eligible.\" It does not explicitly state that the manager has verified the employee's role as remote-eligible. It only states that the role is designated remote-eligible, which could be a pre-existing designation that the manager is aware of, but not necessarily verified.\n\nThis conclusion is not guaranteed because the policy does not explicitly state that the manager has verified the employee's role as remote-eligible. It only states that the role is designated remote-eligible, which could be a pre-existing designation that the manager is aware of, but not necessarily verified.",
