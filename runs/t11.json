  "baseline_output": "Let's analyze the statements step by step.\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that exactly one person is a truth-teller, one is a liar, and one is random.\n\nFrom statement (2), A says 'B is not the liar.' If A is the liar, then B must be the liar, which contradicts A's statement. Therefore, A cannot be the liar. If A is the truth-teller, then B is not the liar. If A is the random one, then B could be either the liar or the truth-teller.\n\nFrom statement (3), B says 'C is not the truth-teller.' If B is the truth-teller, then C is not the truth-teller. If B is the liar, then C is the truth-teller, which contradicts B's statement. If B is the random one, then C could be either the truth-teller or the liar.\n\nFrom statement (4), C says 'A is not the random one.' If C is the truth-teller, then A is not the random one. If C is the liar, then A is the random one, which contradicts C's statement. If C is the random one, then A could be either the truth-teller or the liar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: A is the truth-teller.\n- B is not the liar (from statement 2), so B is either the truth-teller or the random one.\n- C is not the truth-teller (from statement 3), so C is either the liar or the random one.\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), so A is the truth-teller, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\nCase 2: A is the liar.\n- B is the liar (from statement 2), which contradicts our assumption that A is the liar.\n\nCase 3: A is the random one.\n- B is either the liar or the truth-teller (from statement 2).\n- C is either the liar or the truth-teller (from statement 3).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), so A is either the truth-teller or the liar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for B and C:\n\nCase 3a: B is the liar and C is the liar.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nCase 3b: B is the liar and C is the truth-teller.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nCase 3c: B is the truth-teller and C is the liar.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nCase 3d: B is the truth-teller and C is the random one.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nCase 3e: B is the random one and C is the liar.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nCase 3f: B is the random one and C is the truth-teller.\n- A is the random one (from statement 2).\n- A is not the random one (from statement 4), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nHowever, we can see that Case 3a, 3b, 3c, 3e, and 3f all lead to contradictions. Therefore, the only possibility is:\n\nCase 3d: B is the truth-teller and C is the random one.\n\nIn this case, A is the random one. This is consistent with our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the truth-teller is B, the liar is not determined, and the random one is A and C.",
  "swarm_output": "**Determination of Truth-Teller, Liar, and Random Person**\n\nBased on the analysis and logical deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n* A is the truth-teller.\n* B is the liar.\n* C is the random person.\n\nThis solution satisfies all the given conditions and is consistent with the logical deductions.\n\n**Verification**\n\nWe can verify the solution by checking that it satisfies all the given conditions:\n\n* A says: 'B is not the liar.' Since B is the liar, this statement is true.\n* B says: 'C is not the truth-teller.' Since C is the random person, this statement is false.\n* C says: 'A is not the random one.' Since A is the truth-teller, this statement is true.\n\nThe solution is consistent with the given information and logical deductions.",
