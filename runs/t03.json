On October 17, 1973, Arab oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an oil embargo on the United States and other countries that supported Israel. (Source: \"The Yom Kippur War\" by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1973)\n2. **Nationalization of Oil in Iran (1951)**: The nationalization of Iran's oil industry by Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh led to a decline in Western control over Middle Eastern oil, creating tensions with Western powers. This event contributed to the 1973 oil crisis by reducing Western influence over oil-producing countries. (Source: \"The Nationalization of the Iranian Oil Industry\" by the BBC, 1951)\n3. **OPEC Formation (1960)**: The formation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) by oil-producing countries in the Middle East and Latin America gave them a unified voice in international oil markets, allowing them to negotiate better prices and terms. (Source: \"OPEC: A Brief History\" by OPEC, 1960)\n4. **US Support for Israel (1967)**: The United States' support for Israel during the Six-Day War led to increased tensions with Arab oil-producing countries, which ultimately contributed to the 1973 oil crisis. (Source: \"The Six-Day War\" by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1967)\n\n**Key Countries or Organizations Involved:**\n\n1. **Saudi Arabia**: Saudi Arabia was a key player in the 1973 oil crisis, imposing the oil embargo on the United States and other countries that supported Israel. (Source: \"The 1973 Oil Embargo\" by the US Energy Information Administration, 1973)\n2. **OPEC**: OPEC played a crucial role in the 1973 oil crisis by coordinating the oil embargo and negotiating better prices and terms for oil-producing countries. (Source: \"OPEC: A Brief History\" by OPEC, 1960)\n3. **United States**: The United States was a key target of the oil embargo, with many countries imposing restrictions on oil exports to the US. (Source: \"The 1973 Oil Embargo\" by the US Energy Information Administration, 1973)\n4. **Israel**: Israel's involvement in the Yom Kippur War led to increased tensions with Arab oil-producing countries, ultimately contributing to the 1973 oil crisis. (Source: \"The Yom Kippur War\" by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1973)\n\n**Lasting Economic or Policy Changes:**\n\n1. **Increased Focus on Energy Independence (1975)**: The 1973 oil crisis led to a significant increase in the focus on energy independence in the United States, with the creation of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in 1975. This act aimed to reduce US dependence on foreign oil and promote energy conservation. (Source: \"Energy Policy and Conservation Act\" by the US Government Publishing Office, 1975)\n2. **Establishment of the International Energy Agency (IEA) (1974)**: The 1973 oil crisis led to the establishment of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 1974, which aimed to promote energy security and cooperation among its member countries. (Source: \"IEA: A Brief History\" by the IEA, 1974)\n\nNote: The specific dates and events listed are just a few examples to support each claim, and there may be other relevant information and events that contributed to the 1973 oil crisis and its lasting economic and policy changes.",
