  "baseline_output": "Introducing FolderSafe, a simple and reliable desktop app designed to protect your important files from loss or damage. We've all been there - a hard drive crashes, a computer gets stolen, or a file gets accidentally deleted. With FolderSafe, you can rest assured that your cherished memories, documents, and work files are safely backed up to an external drive. This standalone app is specifically designed for home users who want a hassle-free way to safeguard their digital life.\n\nFolderSafe allows you to select the folders you want to back up, and it will automatically create incremental backups to your external drive. This means that only the changes made since the last backup will be stored, saving space and reducing the time it takes to complete the backup process. For added security, you can also choose to encrypt your backups with a password, giving you peace of mind that your sensitive files are protected from unauthorized access. The app is easy to use and requires minimal configuration, making it perfect for those who don't want to deal with complex backup software.\n\nWhile FolderSafe is a great solution for most home users, it may not be suitable for those who need more advanced features, such as cloud backup or automatic backup to multiple locations. If you're looking for a more comprehensive backup solution that can also sync your files across multiple devices, you may want to consider a cloud-based backup service. However, for those who simply want a reliable and easy-to-use desktop app for backing up their files to an external drive, FolderSafe is an excellent choice.",
